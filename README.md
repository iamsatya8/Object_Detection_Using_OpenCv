# Object_Detection_Using_OpenCv

This project demonstrates object detection using OpenCV with Python. It employs image processing techniques to detect and highlight objects in real-time or from static images. The program utilizes pre-trained models and features such as Haar cascades, YOLO, or other detection algorithms to identify objects like faces, cars, or other custom objects within a frame.

# Features:
  Detects objects in real-time using a webcam or video input.
  Highlights detected objects with bounding boxes.
  Supports both image and video file inputs.
  Easy to customize with different models and object types.
# Requirements:
  Python 3.x
  OpenCV
  NumPy
